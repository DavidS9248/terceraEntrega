                    <h2>Tesla History</h2>
                    <p>Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy company founded in 2003 by a
                        group
                        of
                        engineers, including Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon Musk joined the company shortly
                        after
                        its
                        founding and became a major driving force behind its success.

                        The company is named after Nikola Tesla, the renowned inventor and electrical engineer, as a
                        tribute
                        to
                        his
                        pioneering work in electricity and innovation. Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's
                        transition
                        to
                        sustainable energy.

                        Tesla's first major product was the Tesla Roadster, an all-electric sports car introduced in
                        2008.
                        It
                        was
                        the first highway-legal electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. The Roadster demonstrated
                        that
                        electric vehicles could be fast, stylish, and viable for everyday use, challenging the
                        perception
                        that
                        EVs
                        were only practical for short trips and limited to smaller, less powerful vehicles.

                        Following the success of the Roadster, Tesla expanded its product line to include the Model S,
                        Model
                        X,
                        Model 3, and Model Y, covering a range of vehicle types from luxury sedans to SUVs and more
                        affordable
                        options. The company focused on advancing battery technology, enhancing vehicle range, and
                        developing an
                        extensive network of Supercharger stations for rapid charging.

                        Tesla's Autopilot feature, a semi-autonomous driving system, has also garnered significant
                        attention
                        and
                        controversy as it represents a step toward self-driving vehicles. The company has continued to
                        push
                        the
                        boundaries of electric vehicle technology and sustainability.

                        In addition to electric cars, Tesla has ventured into clean energy solutions, such as solar
                        panels
                        and
                        home
                        battery storage (Powerwall and Powerpack), aimed at reducing carbon emissions and providing
                        renewable
                        energy
                        alternatives.</p>
